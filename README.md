|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Built with **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and vanilla **JavaScript** | Powered by **FastAPI**, providing a fast, async REST API | Developed using **TensorFlow** ‚Äî a convolutional neural network trained on the Quick, Draw! dataset |
| Features a responsive drawing canvas with smooth real-time input handling | Accepts and processes base64-encoded canvas images for prediction | Designed to classify simplified grayscale doodles and output the most probable label |
|  | Lightweight and efficient prediction endpoint at `/predict` | |

## üìà Model Analysis
This project uses a small Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict doodles drawn by the user.

- Trained on 50,000 doodles from the Quick, Draw! dataset

- Total parameters: ~1.36 million

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note
<b>The model isn't super accurate yet since it was trained on a small part of the full dataset (50,000 doodles, accounting for only ~4%). </b> But it still works well for common, simple drawings.
